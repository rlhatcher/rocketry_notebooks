This shape is popular in subsonic flight (such as model rocketry) due to the blunt nose and tangent base and are generally considered superior for model rocketry altitude optimisation use. This is not a shape normally found in professional rocketry, which almost always flies at much higher velocities where other designs are more suitable.\n",

The Haack series nose cones are not perfectly tangent to the body at their base except for the case where $C = {2 \\over 3}$. However, the discontinuity is usually so slight as to be imperceptible. For $C > {2 \\over 3}$, Haack nose cones bulge to a maximum diameter greater than the base diameter. Haack nose tips do not come to a sharp point, but are slightly rounded.\n",
